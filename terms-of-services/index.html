<li><strong>Chargeback</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If, at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection 
of a charge of any payable Fees on your User Account (“Chargeback”), 
this will be considered as a breach of your payment obligations 
hereunder, and your use of our Services may be automatically disabled or
 terminated.</p>
<p>In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be 
blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data 
contained in such User Account may be subject to cancellation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to us, we encourage you to first <strong>contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback </strong>or
 reversal of payment, in order to prevent our Services from being 
cancelled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing 
of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your 
being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all 
the Fees applicable to our Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by
 providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution 
with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible
 for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use 
of the services rendered thereafter.</p>
